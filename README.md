# arta

Arta is an asynchronous runtime abstractions library for Rust, designed to provide a flexible and powerful interface for building asynchronous applications. With `arta`, you can abstract over different async runtimes, making your code async runtime agnostic.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing async codebases.
- **Flexible API**: Use a consistent API regardless of the underlying runtime.
- **Lightweight**: No overhead, designed for performance.

## Installation

Add `arta` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
arta = "0.1.0"
